Data source: [https://citibikenyc.com/system-data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)

Data description: Where do Citi Bikers ride? When do they ride? How far do they go? Which stations are most popular? What days of the week are most rides taken on? We've heard all of these questions and more from you, and we're happy to provide the data to help you discover the answers to these questions and more. We invite developers, engineers, statisticians, artists, academics and other interested members of the public to use the data we provide for analysis, development, visualization and whatever else moves you.
